# Experiment 001 – AI-Powered Revenue Briefs

## Hypothesis
Businesses will pay $20+ for rapid, high-quality revenue opportunity briefs tailored to their niche, generated via GPT with curated prompts. Each brief can be produced for <$1 in API spend, yielding >4x ROI per sale.

## Offer
- Deliverable: 3-page PDF outlining growth levers (SEO, partnerships, product tweaks) for a specific business.
- Delivery time: <12 hours.
- Channels: cold outreach + Fiverr/Gumroad listing.

## Budget & Costing
- Estimated tokens per brief: 20k prompt/response total (~$0.60 at GPT-5.1 Codex rates — adjust once pricing confirmed).
- Daily cap: 1–2 briefs while proving demand (≤$5).

## Success Criteria
- Secure at least 1 paying customer (≥$20) within 3 days.
- Positive feedback / testimonial for credibility.

## Execution Steps
1. Craft master prompt templates (business intake + analysis + strategy output).
2. Generate sample brief to showcase quality (publish excerpt on dashboard).
3. Launch offer on Fiverr + Gumroad; prep cold outreach copy.
4. Track every run in ledger.
5. Iterate on prompt if feedback suggests missing depth.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Demand**: start with verticals known to buy strategy (ecom, SaaS). Use cold email targeting founders.
- **Cost overruns**: enforce token budget per brief, monitor ledger.
- **Quality control**: incorporate manual review checklist before delivery.
